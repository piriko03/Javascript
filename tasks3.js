//1. Generate a random number between 0 and 1 and find out if it is less than, greater than or equal to 0.5
//let num = Math.random(0,1);
//console.log(num);
//if (num>0.5) console.log("greater")
//else if (num<0.5) console.log("less")
//else console.log("equals")

//2. Create a program that will find out whether a person has the right to vote
//let age = 17;
//if (age >= 18) console.log("yes")
//else console.log("no")

//3. Create a program that will find out a student's grade based on his grade
//let scr = 34;
//if (scr>90) console.log("A")
//else if (scr>80) console.log("B")
//else if (scr>70) console.log("C")
//else if (scr>60) console.log("D")
//else if (scr>50) console.log("E")
//else console.log("F")

//4. Is the number divisible by 3 and 5?
//let num = 21;
//if (num%3==0 && num%5==0) console.log("yes")
//else console.log("no")

//5. Is the number between 100 and 200?
//let num = 100;
//if (num>=100 && num<=200) console.log("yes")
//else console.log("no")
